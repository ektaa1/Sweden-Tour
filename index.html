            <p class="sectiontag textbig">Stockholm</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">We would love to start our exploration of Sweden from where else, but its
                capital city Stockholm. The city that gave the world the intriguing term of, ‘Stockholm Syndrome’, is a
                treasure house of unique experiences. We would love to lose ourselves in its museums, namely the famous
                Vapa Museum with its 17th-century ship and the ABBA museum which is indeed a Mecca for fans of the
                legendary Swedish Pop Group. Of course one cannot forget to visit the Royal Palace when in Stockholm, it
                is said to be one of the largest palaces in Europe. The colourful and vibrant art in the subway stations
                of Stockholm too beckons with their quirky beauty, not to forget the Stockholm Archipelago.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag textbig">Swedish Lapland</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">We would love to be lost in the dreamy world of Swedish Lapland. The land
                of the Reindeer and the Sami, probably one of the most surreal regions on the earth. We would love to
                hike in this beautiful region where nature engulfs and uplifts your spirit, and adventure beckons.The
                Swedish Lapland’s extreme isolation is one of its greatest appeals.
                While the Lapland region itself stretches across Norway, Finland, and Russia, in addition to Sweden,
                Lappland (double p) is the Swedish province in the nation’s extreme north.The Swedish Lapland Visitors
                Board makes this distant region accessible, however. Fly via one of a handful of carriers into Lulea or
                Kiruna, the two major airports located in Swedish Lapland. While you’ll probably fly into the region,
                once you’re there you can explore by train — and there’s plenty of mysig to be had onboard. One popular
                route runs between Lulea and Kiruna; it’s a great way to experience a taste of everything this remote
                region has to offer.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag textbig">Gothenburg</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">Gothenburg seems to have an enduring charm that is so picturesque. A
                visit to this city is like taking a walk into the realms of a fairytale. There is so much to do in
                Gothenburg apart from digging into a giant cinnamon bun and cruising on the waterways. Of course, a
                visit to Gothenburg would be incomplete without paying a visit to the Gothenburg Museum of Art. The
                Museum is said to be a treasure of 15th-century Nordic art and also has the works of famous masters like
                Monet and Picasso. And of course, the visit would climax at the Gothenburg Archipelago.</p>

        <div class="paras">
            <p class="sectiontag textbig">Ystad</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">The medieval town of Ystad and its cobblestones streets make for a
                delightful walk to assimilate the charm exuded by the town. The churches and monasteries render it with
                a mystical aura that is an experience waiting to happen. Intriguing Ales Stenar or the Kaseberga
                Stonehenge which consists of 59 stones arranged to look like a ship is a place we would love to visit
                when in Ystad. Another reason to visit Ystad is that it is the setting for the crime stories written by
                the Swedish crime writer Henning Mankel who created the famous character of Inspector Wallander. The
                television series has taken Ystad to the world.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag textbig">Abisco National Park</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">Our love of nature and wildlife makes it imperative that we visit the
                Abisko National Park when we are in Sweden. Another bonus apart from the beautiful nature and wildlife
                is the promise of the Aurora Borealis. We have heard that owing to its proximity to the arctic circle,
                it is an ideal location for viewing one of the most beautiful natural phenomena on earth during the
                winter season. It would indeed an unforgettable moment if we were able to see this amazing sight at the
                Abisko National Park.</p>
